      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi Everyone, welcome to my page! I am currently a
        Senior Accountant at a large multi-national corporation in Broomfield, Colorado. I have a BA in Accounting from
        Dakota Wesleyan University and a Master
        of Business Administration from Oregon State University. I have worked in a variety of environments;
        small startups with limited resources, large corporations going through mergers, and sizeable established
        companies. I have worked at the corporate headquarters, small regional offices and even in the maintenance
        offices of a papermill.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite roles have elements in both accounting and
        analytics. I perform the monthly close process regularly and have reconciled countless balance sheets. I
        have experience forecasting, performing variance analysis, budgeting, calculating ROI, and performing other
        analytics related to capital expenditure requests. In many of my roles, I have found myself constricted by
        the limited data mining/BI resources available to people in my position. Most of the time IT has to be
        involved, and their schedules are already too packed to add an accounting project. I have dabbled with data
        mining and VBA in the past but only began to scratch the surface of what tools are out there. I have been
        wanting to dive deeper for years and am excited for the opportunity to learn a new, fun art that will
        compliment my accounting skills.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up 4 hours to the north of Denver, in small town
        Nebraska. My family moved to Colorado when I was just out of high school, so although I've lived in some
        amazing places, I have always thought of Colorado as my second home. I've been fortunate to call Colorado my
        real home for a few years now. In my free time, I like to hike, camp, kayak, go to Rockies games, Red Rocks,
        snowboard, travel, play volleyball and pretty much just stay active and outdoors. I have the best little
        husky pup and I'm sure you'll see his cute pics in some of my projects.<br><br>
        Go Beavs!</p>
